Compilation
------------
Move to the uncompressed destination and run the following command:

        make

or alternatly you can compile it manulally using the following commands:

	g++ -o SiClE main.cpp Phylogeny.cpp SiClE.cpp

Simple Runtime
--------------
You can run the program in the following way:

    ./SiClE [--groupFile <groupFile>] <SearchPrefix> <File1> <File2> .....

Where search term is the prefix of the family or group you want the sisters for and the GroupFile is a list of prefixes that might be in the same group if found in a polyphioletic group together.  The format is show later in tis file.

Complex Runtime
----------------
The main.cpp file is a simple driver for the sister finder class, wihch requires the Phylogeny class included.  From here you should be able to see the somple workings of the progrmand how you would be able to modify this for your own uses
